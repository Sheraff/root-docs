Simple OAuth authentication for your app, using 3rd party providers like Google, GitHub, Twitch, and more. With session cookies, and a dedicated auth database, you can keep your users logged in.

## Invite codes

Invite codes are a way to restrict access to your app. You can generate invite codes and share them with your users. When they sign up, they will need to provide an invite code to access your app.

The codes are handled by the `invitesStore` and are stored in the dedicated `auth` database.

## Session store

The session store is used to keep your users logged in. It matches browsing sessions with user accounts by storing an encrypted session cookie in the user's browser,

The sessions are handled by the `sessionsStore` and are stored in the dedicated `auth` database.

## User ID

The user ID is a unique identifier for each user. It is used to match the user with their session and multiple OAuth providers. This ID can be public as it doesn't contain any sensitive information, and is not used for authentication. It is stored on the client side in an unencrypted cookie, this is what signifies to the client app that the user is logged in.
