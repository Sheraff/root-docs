## requests in dev mode

In production, all requests hit the server. Requests asking for client assets are simply served statically built files.

In development, most of the work is done by Vite for a better Hot Module Replacement (HMR) experience. So requests asking for client assets are served by Vite, and requests aiming at the server are proxied

<Steps>
	<Step>
		Vite dev server on port `3001`
	</Step>

    <Step>
    	Vite proxies `/api` requests to port `3000`
    </Step>

    <Step>
    	The server esbuild has a proxy server listening on port `3000`, and proxies all requests to the server on port `8877`
    </Step>

    <Step>
    	The server esbuild watches the server files and restarts the server on changes. When the server is ready it listens on port `8877`
    </Step>

</Steps>

This long chain of requests is necessary to have a good HMR experience for both the client and the server.

-   most requests are served by Vite, which has a very good HMR
-   if the server is currently restarting (there is no HMR for the server, only restarts), the server proxy will stall the request until the server is ready again

## dev processes

### Before starting

#### `/script`

-   1-time `esbuild` process for bundling dev plugins

### During development

#### `/client`

-   `vite` dev server + `vite` proxy server (1)
-   `tcm` CSS module types generation (1)

#### `/assets`

-   `tsx` launches a `chokidar`watcher (3)

#### `/worker`

-   `tsx` launches an `esbuild` watcher (3)

#### `/server`

-   `tsx` launches an `esbuild` (2)
-   on build, `esbuild` spawns the app server (1)
-   fastify proxy server (1)

#### `/`

-   `turbo` launches some processes (4)
