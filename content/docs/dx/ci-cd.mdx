## Pull Request workflow

Test, version, build, deploy.

### Test

Create a _Secrets and variables_ > _Actions_ > _Repository secrets_ variable named `CI_ENV_FILE` containing your `.env` file contents.

See `.env.example` file to know which variables are required.

## Build artifact

The `bundle.tar.xz` release artifact uploaded to GitHub contains all the files needed for a production deployment.

		<File title="package.json" />
		<File title="pnpm-lock.yaml" />
	</File>
</Files>
