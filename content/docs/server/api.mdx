Type-safe API server with JSON schema validation.

```ts
const schema = {
	response: {
		200: {
			type: "object",
			properties: {
				id: { type: "string" },
				name: { type: "string" },
				position: { type: "number" },
			},
			required: ["id", "name"],
			additionalProperties: false,
		},
		404: {
			type: "object",
			properties: {
				error: { type: "string" },
			},
			required: ["error"],
			additionalProperties: false,
		},
	},
	querystring: {
		type: "object",
		properties: {
			id: { type: "string" },
		},
		required: ["id"],
		additionalProperties: false,
	},
} as const satisfies BaseSchema

// this is the part that is shared between the client and the server
export const tracksRoute = define<typeof schema>({
	url: "/api/tracks",
	method: "get",
})

export const handler = procedure(schema, tracksRoute, {
	handler(request, reply) {
		const { id } = request.query
		const track = tracks.find((track) => track.id === id)
		if (track) {
			reply.code(200).send(track)
		} else {
			reply.code(404).send({ error: "Track not found" })
		}
	},
})
```

With Fastify, using a JSON schema to validate the inputs and outputs makes the requests have 10-20% more throughput <sup>[1](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Routes/#routes-options)</sup>. And using our own `define` and `procedure` functions we can use the same schema to provide type safety on the client side and on the server side.

Under the hood, fastify uses [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) to validate the schema at runtime, and we use [json-schema-to-ts](https://github.com/ThomasAribart/json-schema-to-ts) to obtain TypeScript types from the schemas.
